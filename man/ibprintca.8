.TH IBPRINTCA 8 "September 27, 2006" "OpenIB" "OpenIB Diagnostics"

.SH NAME
ibprintca.pl \- print only the ca specified from the ibnetdiscover output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibprintca.pl
[-R -l] [<ca_guid|node_name>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Faster than greping/viewing with an editor the output of ibnetdiscover,
ibprintca.pl will parse out and print only the CA information for the
CA specified.

Finally, ibprintca.pl will also reuse the cached ibnetdiscover output from
some of the other diag tools which makes it a bit faster than running
ibnetdiscover from scratch.


.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
List the CAs.  (Simply a wrapper for ibhosts)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
Recalculate the ibnetdiscover information, ie do not use the cached
information.  This option is slower but should be used if the diag tools have
not been used for a long time or if there are other reasons to believe that
the fabric has changed.
