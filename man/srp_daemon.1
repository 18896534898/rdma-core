.SH NAME
srp_daemon \- Discovers SRP targets in an InfiniBand Fabric

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B srp_daemon [-vVcaeon] [-d \fIumad-device\fR | -i \fIinfiniband-device\fR [-p \fIport-num\fR]] [-t \fItimoeout(ms)\fR] [-r \fIretries\fR] [-R \fIRescan-time\fR] [-f \fIrules-File\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Discovers and connects to InfiniBand SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) targets in an IB fabric.

Each srp_daemon instance operates on one local port. Upon boot it performs a full rescan of the fabric then waits for an srp_daemon event. An srp_daemon event can be a join of a new machine to the fabric, a change in the capabilities of a machine, an SA change, or an expiration of a predefined timeout.

When a new machine joins the fabric, srp_daemon checks if it is a target. When there is a change of capabilities, srp_daemon checks if the machine has turned into a target. When there is an SA change or a timeout expiration, srp_daemon performs a full rescan of the fabric.

For each target srp_daemon finds, it checks if it should connect to this target according to its rules and if it is already connected to the local port. If it should connect to this target and if it is not connected yet, srp_daemon can either print the target details or connect to it.

.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print more verbose output
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Print even more verbose output (debug mode)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinfiniband-device\fR
Work on \fIinfiniband-device\fR. This option should not be used with -d.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIport-num\fR
Work on port \fIport-num\fR (default 1). This option must be used with -i and should not be used with -d.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIumad-device\fR
Use device file \fIumad-device\fR (default /dev/infiniband/umad0) This option should not be used with -i or -p.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Generate output suitable for piping directly to a
/sys/class/infiniband_srp/srp\-<device>\-<port>/add_target file. 
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Prints all the targets in the fabric, not only targets that are not connected through the local port. (The same as ibsrpdm.)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Execute the connection command, i.e., make the connection to the target.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR
Perform only one rescan and exit. (The same as ibsrpdm.)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR \fIRescan-time\fR
Force a complete rescan every \fIRescan-time\fR seconds. If -R is not specified, no timeout rescans will be performed.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIrules-File\fR
Decide to which targets to connect according to the rules in \fIrules-File\fR. If -f is not specified, all targets will be connected
Each line in the \fIrules-File\fR is a rule which can be either an allow connection or disallow connection according to the first character in the line (a or d accordingly). the rest of the line is values for id_ext, ioc_guid, dgid, service_id. Please take a look at the example section for an example of the file. srp_daemon decide weather to allow or disallow each target according to first rule that match the target. If no rule match the target, the target is allowed and will be connected.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fItimoeout\fR
Use timeout of \fItimoeout\fR msec for MAD responses (default: 5 sec).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIretries\fR
Perform \fIretries\fR retries on each send to MAD (default: 3 retries).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
New format - use also initiator_ext in the connection command.

.SH EXAMPLES
srp_daemon -e -i mthca0 -p 1 -R 60 (Connects to the targets accessible through port 1 of mthca0. Performs a complete rescan every minute)
srp_daemon -o -c -a		   (Prints the connection commands for the targets in the fabric and exits - similar to ibsrpdm)

srp_daemon -e -f rules.txt		   (Connects to the targets allowed in the rules file rules.txt)
