    libcxgb3: Don't hold locks around QP and CQ destruction.
    
    Don't hold the object lock around object destruction.  It results
    in a deadlock situation where one thread is blocked in the common
    libibverbs destroy method awaiting events to be acked, and the other
    thread trying to access the object to service the event.

commit 42359ad5c2684b8b05d9ffb9f161e4bb9d724de2
Author: Steve Wise <swise@opengridcomputing.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 19 09:36:04 2007 -0600

    Use the chelsio device number to determine the type of adapter.
    
    The existing code was using the sysfs files to obtain the adapter type
    or hw revision.  This method wasn't portable to older distros because
    it used sysfs entries not inserted by the rdma core, but rather by the
    PCI subsystem.  Further, these files don't exist in RHEL4u4! This code
    was implemented before it was known that the chelsio device numbers
    actually encode the hw revision.
    
    The simpler and portable solution is to just determine the hardware
    revision based on the device number.

commit fb02c47a6774f46283cc87cb32709b35f5df94b6
Author: Roland Dreier <rolandd@cisco.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 10 16:53:55 2007 -0600

    Update libcxgb3 for new libibverbs driver handling
    
    The latest libibverbs development tree changes how low-level drivers
    are found.  The driver must be in a shared object like
    libcxgb3-rdmav2.so in the ordinary library path, rather than
    infiniband/cxgb3.so as for libibverbs 1.0.  In addition, the driver
    must call ibv_register_driver() to pass its entry point to libibverbs,
    rather than exporting an ibv_driver_init() function.
    
    Since the current libcxgb3 tree is targeted only for libibverbs
    development trees and won't work with libibverbs 1.0, this patch
    changes libcxgb3 to work with the new libibverbs way of loading
    drivers without any autoconf tests.

    r9914: Poll fixes and T3B semantics for user mode.
    
    - Support T3B poll semantics
    - Support unsignaled sq wrs correctly
    - Support out of order read completions without stalling the entire cq
    
    The above changes were done by adding a SW SQ where out of order
    completions are stored until they become in-order, at which time they
    get flushed into the SW CQ.  This makes for a simplified overall poll
    and also supports unsignaled SQ WRs.
