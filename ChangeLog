	* src/srp-dm.c (get_port_list): In some setups (eg Cisco SFS 3001
	with an FC gateway), there will be switches with the IsDM bit set
	on port 0.  So the initial get of NodeRecords must retrieve all
	records, not just CA ports.

	* src/srp-dm.c (do_port): Use correct endianness when comparing
	GUID against Topspin OUI.

	* src/srp-dm.c (set_class_port_info): Trivial whitespace fixes.

2006-05-29  Ishai Rabinovitz  <ishai@mellanox.co.il>

	* src/srp-dm.c (main): The agent ID array is declared with 0
	entries, which leads to corruption when it is filled in by
	create_agent().  Fix that by declaring it with the correct number
	of entries, 2.

2006-04-10  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* configure.in: srptools no longer needs to check for libsysfs.

	* src/srp-dm.c: Remove use of libsysfs -- just read directly to
	get what we need.
	Make functions static, since they are only used in one file.

	* src/ib_user_mad.h: Use __u16/__u32 instead of __be16/__be32,
	since not all toolchains export __beXX types to userspace.

2006-01-17  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* Release as version 0.03
