	* include/infiniband/driver.h, src/cmd.c, src/libibverbs.map: Add
	command functions for calling new kernel commands.

	* include/infiniband/verbs.h: Add qp_type to struct ibv_qp so that
	we know when we're posting a send on a UD QP, and add kernel
	handle member to struct ibv_ah so we can handle drivers that do
	create AH and destroy AH operations in the kernel.
	
	* include/infiniband/kern-abi.h: Add new command structures for
	poll CQ, request notification for CQ, post send, post receive,
	post SRQ receive, create AH and destroy AH commands.  These will
	be used by the PathScale userspace driver.

2005-10-12  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* examples/srq_pingpong.c (main): Zero out unused entries in
	my_dest array to avoid string overflows when we send to the other
	side.

2005-10-09  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* examples/devinfo.c (print_hca_cap): Only print max_mr_size and
	page_size_cap if verbose is set.

2005-10-05  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* src/cmd.c (ibv_cmd_modify_srq): Add function for marshalling
	modify SRQ command.

2005-09-29  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* examples/devinfo.c (print_hca_cap): Get rid of formatting of
	firmware version in what should be device-independent code.

	* include/infiniband/driver.h, include/infiniband/verbs.h,
	src/cmd.c (ibv_cmd_query_device): Change firmware version in
	struct ibv_device_attr to be a string formatted by device-specific
	library.

2005-09-25  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* examples/rc_pingpong.c, examples/srq_pingpong.c,
	examples/uc_pingpong.c, examples/ud_pingpong.c: Update to match
	new completion channel and CQ creation API.

	* include/infiniband/driver.h, include/infiniband/verbs.h,
	src/device.c, src/ibverbs.h, src/verbs.c, src/cmd.c: Add notion of
	"completion channel" that allows consumers to dynamically create
	and destroy file descriptors for retrieving completion events.
	Completion channels are handled natively with kernel ABI version 3
	and simulated with backwards compatibility implementations for ABI
	versions 1 and 2.

	* include/infiniband/kern-abi.h: Update to match kernel ABI
	version 3.

2005-09-07  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* src/device.c (ibv_get_device_guid): Use htonll() instead of
	relying on pointer aliasing (which seems to break for some gcc
	versions).

	* include/infiniband/arch.h: Add htonll() and ntohll() functions.

2005-09-06  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* include/infiniband/kern-abi.h, include/infiniband/verbs.h,
	src/cmd.c, src/device.c, src/verbs.c, examples/asyncwatch.c:
	Update to handle new kernel ABI for avoiding stale completion
	events.  This is completely analogous to the previous asynchronous
	event change.

2005-08-31  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* include/infiniband/kern-abi.h, include/infiniband/verbs.h,
	src/cmd.c, src/device.c, src/ibverbs.h, src/init.c, src/verbs.c,
	examples/asyncwatch.c: Update to handle new kernel ABI for
	avoiding stale asynchronous events.  When a CQ, QP or SRQ is
	destroyed, the kernel reports the number of events it has given to
	userspace, and we wait until we've handled the same number of
	events.

	This does introduce a library API change: consumers are now
	required to call ibv_put_async_event() to release every
	asynchronous event that they retrieve via ibv_get_async_event().

2005-08-30  Roland Dreier  <roland@cisco.com>

	* man/ibv_asyncwatch.1, man/ibv_devices.1, man/ibv_devinfo.1,
	man/ibv_rc_pingpong.1, man/ibv_srq_pingpong.1,
	man/ibv_uc_pingpong.1, man/ibv_ud_pingpong.1: Add man pages for
	example programs.

	* examples/devinfo.c: Merge with Dotan Barak's vstat tool.
