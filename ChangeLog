	src/cmd.c, src/device.c, src/ibverbs.h, src/init.c, src/verbs.c,
	examples/asyncwatch.h: Update to handle new kernel ABI for
	avoiding stale asynchronous events.  When a CQ, QP or SRQ is
	destroyed, the kernel reports the number of events it has given to
	userspace, and we wait until we've handled the same number of
	events.

	This does introduce a library API change: consumers are now
	required to call ibv_put_async_event() to release every
	asynchronous event that they retrieve via ibv_get_async_event().
