InfiniBand Diagnostic Tools

infiniband-diags is a set of utilities designed to help configure, debug, and
maintain infiniband fabrics.  Many tools and utilities are provided.  Some with
similar functionality.

scan an entire IB fabric and return data structures representing it.  The
interface to this library is _not_ guaranteed to be stable (though we try.)
