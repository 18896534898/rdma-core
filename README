This README is for userspace RDMA cm library.

Building

To make this directory, run:
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Typically the autogen and configure steps only need be done the first
time unless configure.in or Makefile.am changes.

Libraries are installed by default at /usr/local/lib.

Device files

The userspace CMA uses a single device file regardless of the number
of adapters or ports present.

To create the appropriate character device file automatically with
udev, a rule like

    KERNEL="ucma", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"

can be used.  This will create the device node named

    /dev/infiniband/ucma

or you can create it manually

  mknod /dev/infiniband/ucma c 231 255
