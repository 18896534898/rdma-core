iWarp Port Mapper Library - libiwpm

DESCRIPTION

libiwpm provides a user space service for the iWarp drivers Intel nes and Chelsio cxgb4
to claim tcp ports through the standard socket interface.

PREREQUISITES

libiwpm requires libnl-1 or higher version and the corresponding libnl-devel
to be installed.

The kernel space support for libiwpm is currently included in the ib_core module, which
needs to be loaded in order for the libiwpm service to start successfully.
If the libiwpm is installed, but the ib_core isn't loaded, then you need to load the
ib_core and then start the libiwpm service.

STARTING THE SERVICE

After installing the OFED package, the libiwpm service should have started automatically after reboot.
(Assuming the libiwpm has been installed successfully and the ib_core module has been loaded)

You can also start/stop the libiwpm service using:
service iwpmd start
service iwpmd stop
