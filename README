InfiniBand Diagnostic Tools

infiniband-diags is a set of utilities designed to help configure, debug, and
maintain infiniband fabrics.  Many tools and utilities are provided.  Some with
similar functionality.

In addition to the utilities provided a sub-library libibnetdisc is provided to
scan an entire IB fabric and return data structures representing it.  The
interface to this library is _not_ guaranteed to be stable (though we try.)

Dependencies:

	1) libibmad >= 1.3.9
	2) libibumad >= 1.3.7
	3) opensm-libs >= 3.3.10
	4) ib_umad kernel module


Release notes v1.5.13 => v1.6.0

   1) Fixed "sa_key" (SA smkey) in saquery.  Along with this the default smkey
      has been changed to 0.  This means the default queries are "untrusted".
      A different default (for example to match OpenSM) can be configured in
      the ibdiags.conf to have "trusted" queries by default.

   2) Some older tools have been deprecated and are no longer in the default
      build.

	ibcheckerrs ibchecknet ibchecknode ibcheckport ibcheckportwidth
	ibcheckportstate ibcheckwidth ibcheckstate ibcheckerrors ibdatacounts
	ibdatacounters ibdiscover.pl ibswportwatch.pl ibqueryerrors.pl
	iblinkinfo.pl ibprintca.pl ibprintswitch.pl ibprintrt.pl
	set_nodedesc.sh ibclearerrors ibclearcounters

      Building these tools can be enabled through configure with the
      --enable-compat-utils option.

      infinband-diags-1.6.x.tar.gz includes this option and will generate the
      *-compat rpm by default.

   3) mkey support

   4) Additional tools ibccquery ibccconfig

   5) "-u" option is no longer supported (use "-h" instead)

   6) New updated man pages

   7) support for new hardware in vendstat

   8) bug fixes and code clean up
