Introduction
============

libmthca is a userspace driver for Mellanox InfiniBand HCAs.  It works
as a plug-in module for libibverbs that allows programs to use
Mellanox hardware directly from userspace.  See the libibverbs package
for more information.

Using libmthca
==============

libmthca will be loaded and used automatically by programs linked with
libibverbs.  The ib_mthca kernel module must be loaded for HCA devices
to be detected and used.

Supported Hardware
==================

libmthca currently supports HCAs based on the following Mellanox chips:

    MT23108 InfiniHost (PCI-X)
    MT25208 InfiniHost III Ex (PCI Express)
    MT25208 InfiniHost III Lx (PCI Express)

Both non-DDR and DDR HCAs are supported, and the MT25208 is supported
with both MT23108-compatible and native MemFree firmware.
